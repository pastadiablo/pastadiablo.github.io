Plants grow in different patterns. (Basil grows one way, tomatoes another)

Trimming or cutting plants is the mechanic (good for touch screens mostly)

All "leaves" of the plant divide the amount of "growth" of the plant evenly amongst themselves

Goal?  Points?

Goal idea: Harvest most fruit / leaves possible by X days.

Genetically engineer a superior plant - crossbreed plants to gain traits / characteristics / growth patterns

Example Traits:
- Leaves re-grow from cut branch after being cut
-
