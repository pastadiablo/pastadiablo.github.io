1. Install Ruby with devkit. For more information, see ["Ruby Installer"](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) in the Ruby documentation.
2. Bundler should come with your Ruby installation. If not, install it.
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve`
5. Preview the site at `http://localhost:4000`
