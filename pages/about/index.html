Hi there.
<p>
I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to try and keep a conversational tone here.  I've never been terribly good at sounding professional, and I think a poor attempt at it would be far worse than just having a fun little chat.  Hopefully you agree.  If not, feel free to stop here.  I won't mind.
<p>
As far as software engineering, or software development, or programming, or whatever is the most correct term to use these days goes, I've not been in the game that long.  I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2011, so I've only been at this for about five years as of the time of this writing (no guarantees that I'll update this every year, I'll probably forget I dated my About section).  
<p>
My first stint was at a place called SRRN Games, a cool startup that spawned from a number of minds at the Darden business school at UVA.  I was with them, and their spin-off company Evenspring, a consulting firm that kept the lights on so we could occasionaly work on games, for about 4 years before Evenspring sold and SRRN Games stopped well, doing things.  
<p>
In the sale I was acqui-hired by the Timmons Group, a civil engineering firm that Evenspring had done a bunch of work for throughout the years.  I'm currently situated there as a mobile developer, doing mobile enterprise application development, although we sometimes do other things that aren't enterprise, or mobile, or...applications.  The world of Geographic Information Systems consulting can be a strange one.  Our work often doesn't even include actual GIS technology, although I believe that is the core of our business.  
<p>
For the most part these days I work on native iPhone apps, like the Oregon Zoo Elephant Lands Exhibit Companion App (that's a mouthful) or the Wyoming 511 transportation app.  
<p>
During my years at SRRN and Evenspring I worked with lots of tech and lots of systems.  I made many games and prototypes in Unity, worked on a website with AngularJS, developed (you guessed it) native iPhone apps, setup and administered our bug-tracking and continuous deployment pipelines, and even wrote a photoshop plug-in script...thing....once.  For batching images.  It was a strange time.
<p>
You can read more details about those and all my other past projects on the projects page.  It's got a fancy-pants timeline and everything.
<p>
If you are less interested in the past, and more interested in the present, you can contact me at any of the links up near my face.  I worry having my face up there is tacky.  Do you think it's tacky?  Let me know.  Seriously.  I've lost sleep over this.
<p>
You can also check out some of my most recent blog posts on the homepage of the site, or trawl through the archives of everything I have written for the blog in the Archive section.  Although, full disclosure, I haven't written any blog posts as of the writing of this "About" page, so, I'm really hoping by the time you read this I've gotten some stuff up there.
<p>
