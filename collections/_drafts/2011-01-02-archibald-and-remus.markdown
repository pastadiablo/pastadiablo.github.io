The Minor Lords was a quirky Tower Defense game for Android that chronicles the exploits of two medieval squatters, Archibald and Remus, as they go and live in  nobles castles while they're on vacation, only to find themselves having to defend the castles from other squatters.

Using tongue-in-cheek humor and event-driven back and forth voice-acted dialogue to convey a heartwarming tale of two men who dare to dream, Minor Lords was one of the best games SRRN worked on even though it didn't get much, if any, attention when released, and is no longer available on any store.

My contribution to Minor Lords was small, but somewhat significant.  I worked on creep wave and tower balance, as well as creation of the pathing information for each level.
