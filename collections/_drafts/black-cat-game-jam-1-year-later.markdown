So. It's been a wild year for me. Lot's of ups and downs. I got a new job teaching grad students mobile dev, loved it, then ended up picking up a second job (the first one didn't do health insurance, which I needed bad), then I hated the first job cause I couldn't do it right, and now I'm here. At the end of the summer, having just the one job.

Well there's also what I did this summer too I suppose.
