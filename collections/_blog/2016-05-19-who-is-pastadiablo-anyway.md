Hi there. It's me. I'm pastadiablo. I'm also Dan Magnusson. I've been both for a long time, though the latter about 13 years longer than the former. 

If you're here about cute pixel 🐈‍⬛Voids🐈‍⬛, peep the embed to the right 👉, or click the link above ☝️. Excuse the color clash, I was in a Blue mood when I last re-did my sites palette, and it just doesn't match my game about adorable eldritch 🐈‍⬛Voids🐈‍⬛ aesthetic. I'm sure I'll update it at some point soon. 

If you want to know more about me, read on.

I'm a __software engineer__ by trade who likes making games in his spare time featuring pixel art that treads the line between cute and creepy.

In the past I've worked at almost every size of company / team you can think of throughout the years. For 6 years I worked at Amazon on a number of teams doing software dev. I've also been a part of an indie game studio, worked as an independent contractor, spent time as an associate faculty member teaching grad students mobile development, and even for a while worked at a civil engineering firm! 

These days I work at Lowe's Innovation Labs as a Senior iOS Engineer doing native mobile development in Swift. I enjoy that work a lot, and the skills I've developed as a native mobile engineer throughout my career brings me great satisfaction.

My real passion however is my game development. It's why I first learned to program after all. I still remember with fondness the command-line pvp tic-tac-toe game I created in C++. I had just started teaching myself C++ about a month before, so, prodigy that I was, I put everything in one function and just copy-pasted logic checks for all the various victory conditions. It was so much more work than it needed to be, but it got me hooked!

My current main project is a hidden-cat counting memory game about adorable eldritch Voids. The origin of this game was a game jam in the summer of 2024, and you can read my post-mortem of that [here](/blog/black-cat-game-jam/). If you'd like to know more, and/or sign up for beta access, you can subscribe to my [newsletter](/projects/voids/){:.newtab}.

You can contact me or download my latest resume at the links in the top right. You can also check out some of my most recent blog posts and read little articles about things I've worked on.  Although, full disclosure, I haven't written many blog posts as of the writing of this "About" page, so, I'm really hoping by the time you read this I've gotten some stuff up there.
