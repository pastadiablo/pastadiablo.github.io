Fresh off of the Cult Horror Game Jam, I was addicted. I wanted to do another. I was feeling good. So I looked around and found the [Black Cat Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/black-cat-jam-1). Sadly I had to do this one without my friend, as it wasn't his jam (haha).

If you take a peak at the [results](https://itch.io/jam/black-cat-jam-1/results) page, you'll see that my submission, Count the Voids, took first place in this jam, out of 128 other games submitted.  Not too shabby!
